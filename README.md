E-Commerce Website (Django)

This is a simple e-commerce website developed to meet the requirements of my WSD project.

Features :

1. User Authentication:
* User can sign up with a username and password.
* User can log in with their credentials.
* Authentication ensures that users can only add items to the cart when logged in.

2. Product Management:
* Product listing page with titles, images, and prices.
* Each product has an option to add to the cart (only available for logged-in users).

3. Cart Functionality:
* Users can add items to their cart.
* Users can view and update the cart.
